Microsoft R Server
======================================

Welcome to the Slalom Microsoft R Server Course Repository. While this course is intended for data scientists and analysts interested in the Microsoft R programming stack (i.e., Microsoft employees in the Algorithms and Data Science group), other programmers might find the material useful as well.

## Course Outline

Please refer to the [course syllabus](https://github.com/janetg-slalom/MRS-Student-Resources/wiki/Syllabus) for the full syllabus. The goal of this course is to cover the following modules, although some of the latter modules may be repalced for a hackathon/office hours.

+ Topics:
    * R Fundamentals
    * Data Manipulation with [`dplyr`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/)
    * Data Manipulation with [`dplyrXdf`](https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/dplyrXdf)
    * Modeling and Scoring with Microsoft R
    * Parallel Computing with the `RevoScaleR` package
    * HDInsights Insights

## DSVMs

We will use iPython Notebooks (via Jupyter) on DSVMs (Data Science Virtual Machines) from the Azure marketplace to run the course materials. We will be providing only a brief overview of HDInsights (Hadoop & Spark); we expect to offer this material in a different course. If you are interested in running course materials locally, see the course [wiki](https://github.com/janetg-slalom/MRS-Student-Resources/wiki/Running-R-Server-locally-with-R-Client) for instructions. 
   
## RStudio
RStudio, the most population R IDE, is not installed on the DSVM.  All course material will be provided in R script files as well as iPython Notebooks.  If you perfer to use R Studio locally you must install R Server locally.

### Credentials

+ We will send you credentials to log into the training environment by email.
