# US-Pollution-R-Server-Demo
This is a end-to-end data science solution focusing on using R Server and SQL Server 2016 components. In this project we will use the US Pollution data set found at https://www.kaggle.com/sogun3/uspollution.

Download this file and place it into the Input Data folder after the project is cloned. 

Note: Project focuses on using the RevoScaleR package of functions found in installations of Microsoft R Server and SQL Server 2016 w/ R Services integration. Users must have these programs installed to fully get value from the project. 



R & SQL code from the SQL Server & R demo use:

1. Download the pollution_us_2000_2016.csv data set from the Kaggle dataset website:
	https://www.kaggle.com/sogun3/uspollution
	
2. Clone the project and place the folder into a directory of your choice.

4. Reset paths in code

5. Run code in numerical order. 

NOTE: You will have to have a SQL Server 2016 instance to run the 4 - SQL Server Modeling.R script and all of the SQL sprocs.
